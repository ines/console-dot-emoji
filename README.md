# Custom Console Logging with Emoji

Debugging JavaScript can be painful and often means spending hours looking at boring console logs. Inspired by [console.frog](http://tholman.com/console-dot-frog/) by Tim Holman, I made my own console logger &mdash; but with customizable commands and emojis. Logging to the console is finally fun again, thanks to `console.beer` :beer: and `console.unicorn` ðŸ¦„.
